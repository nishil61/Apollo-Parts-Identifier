An AI-powered image processing system to automate the recognition and classification of mechanical parts for Gujarat Apollo Industries Ltd. This tool streamlines inventory management, reduces human error, and improves assembly accuracy by providing an intuitive, user-friendly interface for real-time part identification.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Input Methods**: Upload images or use live webcam feed for real-time identification
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback with confidence scores for identified parts
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design with clear visual feedback
- **High Accuracy**: Powered by a custom TensorFlow model trained on mechanical part images

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam (for live detection feature)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishilpathak/Apollo-Part-Identifier.git
   cd Apollo-Part-Identifier
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Download the model**
   
   The model file is too large for GitHub. Download it from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/your-model-link) and place it in the `model/` directory with the filename `teachable_machine_model.h5`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

Start the Streamlit server:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìä Creating Your Own Model with Teachable Machine

You can create your own custom part identification model using Google's Teachable Machine:

1. **Visit Teachable Machine**
   - Go to [teachablemachine.withgoogle.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
   - Click on "Get Started" and select "Image Project" ‚Üí "Standard Image Model"

2. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Create two classes, for example: "Correct Part" and "Incorrect Part", or specific part names like "Bearing" and "Gear".
   - For each class: Upload 30+ images of the corresponding mechanical parts.
   - Ensure images have varied lighting, angles, and positions for better generalization

3. **Train Your Model**
   - Click the "Train Model" button
   - Wait for training to complete (usually takes 1-3 minutes)

4. **Export Your Model**
   - Click "Export Model"
   - Select "Tensorflow" ‚Üí "Keras"
   - Download the model file (.h5 format)
   - Place the downloaded model in the `model/` directory with the name `teachable_machine_model.h5`

5. **Test Your Custom Model**
   - Restart the Apollo Part Identifier application
   - Your custom model will be automatically loaded
